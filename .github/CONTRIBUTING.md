## Branching Strategy

- Create a new branch for each feature, bug fix, or improvement you're working on. Use a descriptive branch name, such as `feature/new-command` or `bugfix/issue-123`.

- Make sure your branches are based on the latest `master` branch to avoid merge conflicts.

## Code Style and Standards

- Follow the Python [PEP 8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for code formatting. We use tools like `black` and `isort` to enforce these standards.

- Use meaningful variable and function names. Code readability is important.

- Document your code. Provide comments and docstrings to explain your code's functionality.


## Pull Requests

- Submit a pull request (PR) from your branch to the `master` branch of the main repository.

- Provide a clear and descriptive title for your PR.

- Include a detailed description of your changes in the PR description. Mention any related GitHub issues if applicable.

- Ensure that your code passes all tests and doesn't introduce any new issues.

- Be responsive to feedback. Our maintainers and reviewers may request changes or provide suggestions to improve your code.

## Code Review

- Address all feedback and comments promptly. It helps expedite the review process and ensures that your contributions align with the project's goals.
